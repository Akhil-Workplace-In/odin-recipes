    <h3>Instruction to Prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and boil 500 grams of potatoes (1.1 pounds, about 3 to 4 medium) until just done. I washed peeled, halved and pressure cooked them for 1 whistle on a medium flame. The potatoes should not turn mushy but must be fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Cool the potatoes and crumble them. Set aside.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h3>Make Samosa Dought</h3>

            <ul>

            </ul>           
        <li>Mix everything very well. Rub the flour in between your palms to incorporate the oil well for 2 to 3 minuts. After this step the flour should resemble breadcrumbs. Press down a handful of this flour in your palm, it should form or hold the shape. It should not crumble meaning oil is well incorporated. </li>
        <li>Add 4 tablespoons water and begin to form a dough ball adding more water as needed. I added about 4 + 2 tablespoons water in total.</li>
        <li>Dough has to be firm, stiff and not sticky. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 mins.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make Potato Stuffing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil or ghee in a pan. Next add <small>3/4</small> teaspoon cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>When the seeds begin to splutter, add 1 tablespoon minced ginger and 1 to 2 choped green chilies. Saute for 30 to 60 seconds.Then add a pinch of hing. </li>
        <li>Add the spice powders-
            <ul>
                <li><small>3/4</small>teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder(adjust to taste)</li>
                <li><small>1/2</small>teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li><small>3/4</small>to 1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon amchur powder(dried mango powder) or chaat masala (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon fennel powder (optional, saunf powder)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Saute for 30 seconds and then add green peas. Saute for 1 to 2 mins. Then add potatoes.</li>
        <li>Saute the entire potato masala for 2 to 3 mins until potatoes blend well with spice powders. Add 1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves. Taste test this and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Set aside to cool. If you have not used amchur or chaat masala, then add lemon juice at this stage.</li>
        <h3>Make Samosa</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After 25 to 30 mins, knead the dough for another 3 to 4 mins. The dough has to be stiff yet not soft. Divide the dought to 5 equal parts.</li>
            <li>Oil the counter or the rolling board. Place the ball.</li>
            <li>Roll it to a oval shaped even layer. Mine war 8.5 inches long and 6.5 inches wide. It has to be slighly thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li>Cut it in the center to make 2 parts.</li>
            <li>The roti shrinks back little due to the nature of all-purpose flour so I prefer to roll it gently again. If you feel the edges are too thick then roll a bit.</li>
            <li>Apply water with your finger over the straight edge.</li>
            <li>Join the edges to make a cone shape like you see in the picture. Stick the edges well. Stick the edge form inside the cone as well to secure.</li>
            <li>Fill the cone with potato masala. Press down a bit with a tiny spoon.</li>
            <li>Apply water on the edge.</li>
            <li>Stick the edges to seal well. On one of the sides, make a pleat as shown in the image. </li>
            <li>Bring the pleat to a side and stick it up. Make sure your samosa is sealed well. Pinch and Press down on the edges very well to seal them.</li>
            <li>This will give you a perfectly standing samosa. Finish making all your samosas.If you prefer to bake them, preheat the oven to 360 F to 180C for 20 mins. Brush oil generously and bake them for 30 to 40 minuts, flipping them after 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Fry Samosa</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil for deep frying. The oil should not be very hot or smoky hot. It must be medium hot. When it is just getting hot, add a small portion of dough in the oil.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the samosas one by one slowly. After you add them to the hot oil. you must see very tiny bubbles rising slowly. You should not be hearing any sizzling noise as it happens with the regular deep fried snaks.</li>
            <li>Don't rush. They will take a lot of time to fry golden. Be patient and fry until golden & crisp. When the samosas turn golden, remove them to colander or kitchen tissue. For the next batch, reduce the heat completely to bring down the temperature and add them.</li>
            <li>Serve samosa with mint chutney, Sweet tamarind chutney or tomato sauce.</li>
        </ol>
