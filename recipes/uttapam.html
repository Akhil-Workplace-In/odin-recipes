        <li>2 to 3 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>one large onion</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato</li>
        <li><small>1/2</small>cup carrot</li>
        <li>2 to 3 green chillies</li>
        <li><small>1/4</small>cup coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instruction to Prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds to a large bowl and rinse thrice. Pour fresh water and soak them for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, rinse rice and soak it well for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Add poha to a small bowl & rinse it once. Then soak it in 1/4 cup water at least 15 mins before blending.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from dal and add it to a grider jar along with soaked poha.</li>
        <li>Pour 3/4 cup water and grind to a thick & frothy batter. It has to be of pouring consistency and not runny. If the batter is too thick pour another 2 to 4 tbsps water and grind. Transfer this to the bowl. Ensure the batter doesn't become hot or warm while blending.</li>
        <li>Drain water from teh rice and add it to the grinder. Pour 1.2 cup  water.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth. Transfer to the same urad dal batter bowl and add salt.</li>
        <li>If the weather is too hot then avoid adding salt at this stage. Add it after fermentation.</li>
        <li>After mixing the consistency of the uttapam batter must be thick & purable but not be too thick or too runny.</li>
        <li>Cover and rest in a warm place overnight or until the batter rises. If you live in a cold region, then you may ferment the batter in a instant pot with the yogurt setting (low). Depending on the weather it takes anywhere from 8 to 16 hours.</li>
        <li>Do not oover ferment else the batter turns sour. After fermentation the batter rises and aerates. You will see bubbles over  the batter much like the dosa batter.</li>        
    </ol>
    <h3>How to Make Uttapam</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>When the pan is hot enough, pour a ladle full of batter in the center of the hot pan. We usually do not spread it as it does a bit on its own. If needed spread a bit gently.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and sprinkle the toppings all over the uttapam. Sprinkle oil around the edges and over the onions.</li>
        <li>When the base is firm, flip it and cook on the other side until it is cooked well. Cook on a medium flame at this stage as it needs to cook from inside.</li>
        <li>Cook the toppings to suit your liking - caramelized or crunchy. Set aside and make the next one.</li>
        <li>Serve onion uttapam with chutney or sambar or sprinkle podi.</li>
    </ol>
